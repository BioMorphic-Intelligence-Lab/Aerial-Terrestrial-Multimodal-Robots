# Aerial Terrestrial Multimodal Robots Database
Database of reviewed literature for the review paper entitled _Multi-modal Locomotion: Next Generation Aerial-terrestrial Mobile Robotics_

## Description
Database of reviewed literature for the review paper entitled Multi-modal Locomotion: Next Generation Aerial-terrestrial Mobile Robotics

The database contains literature references of drone prototypes distinguishing among three primary design approaches: 1) additive design: when the morphology of the robot remains unchanged while varying modalities; 2) adaptive design: when robots are capable of altering their morphology (or morph) to traverse different domains effectively; and 3) multi-vehicle design: involves the use of multiple vehicles working together to achieve multimodal functionality.

Within each category, subcategories have been defined according to their forms, structures and mechanisms of movement.

The references go from years 2000 to 2023 adding up a total of 64 prototypes.

See the associated peer reviewed publication for further analysis on the classification, and the advantages and current limitations of each (sub)category.
